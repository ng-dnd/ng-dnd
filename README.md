## Why I create this project?

The `angular-skyhook` is a great library, but I had encountered some frustrations.

- It dosen't support **Angular Ivy** (v9+), please check [this issue](https://github.com/cormacrelf/angular-skyhook/issues/512) for more details.
- It hasn't been maintained for almost two years, the version of `dnd-core` and other packages are very old.
- The naming of some directives and properties aren't very intuitive such as `ssSortable`.
