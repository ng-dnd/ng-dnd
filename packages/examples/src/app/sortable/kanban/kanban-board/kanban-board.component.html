<!--
This is the 'sugared' version.
Use dnd-sortable-list, and give it a template for how to
render each element. It will handle creating the `*ngFor`
for you, from the list the spec provides, and will help
you pass context down to [dndSortableRender].
--->

<dnd-sortable-list class="kanban-root"
  [hoverTrigger]="hoverTrigger"
  [listId]="888"
  [spec]="specs.boardSpec"
  [horizontal]="true">
  <!-- 'horizontal' makes the hover behave differently. You need CSS to complete the job.
  .kanban-root must still be like a block element, so no collapsing float containers.
  Flexbox/CSS Grid are great. -->

  <!-- The dnd-sortable-list component stamps out one dndSortableTemplate
  for each item in yourSpec.getList(). -->
  <ng-template dndSortableTemplate let-context>
    <!-- context is everything the dndSortableRender needs to do its job.
    It includes 'data' and 'index', which are just from an *ngFor of your spec's getList(). -->
    <kanban-list [dndSortableRender]="context"
      [list]="context.data"
      (addCard)="addCard(context.data.id, $event)">

      <!-- is this kanban-list draggable? NOT YET.

      -   because dndSortableRender doesn't know which DOM element should be
      draggable (maybe you want a drag handle), it lets us decide by
      giving us `render.source`, a DragSource object that is already
      configured. You are responsible for connecting it to the DOM.
      If you weren't using child components, you might just do:

      <div class="each-child"
        [dndSortableRender]="context"
        #render="dndSortableRender"
      [dragSource]="render.source"></div>

      -   you can either get the directive using `#render="dndSortableRender"`,
      or inject SkyhookSortableRenderer<KanbanList> into KanbanListComponent.

      -   we did the latter here, because we want a 'drag handle' inside kanban-list.
      the other way is demonstrated with the list of cards inside kanban-list.
      -->

    </kanban-list>
  </ng-template>

</dnd-sortable-list>

<div class="trash-zone">
  <kanban-trash-can (dropped)="removeCard($event)" />
  <kanban-external />
</div>
