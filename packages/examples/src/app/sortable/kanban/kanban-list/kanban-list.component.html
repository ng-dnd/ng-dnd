  This is the 'desugared' style, where you render an *ngFor explicitly.
  It's useful for integrating with other libraries like Material,
  hopefully. Other libraries love to include *ngFor themselves, but it
  should be clear you can attach `dndSortable` to whatever element you want,
  and then `dndSortableRender` to any of its children, even if they are not
  direct children or if some other library only lets you change the item
  template. You can even put a header element inside.

  Do not use both `dnd-sortable-list` AND `dndSortable` -- you will get
  double drop events!
