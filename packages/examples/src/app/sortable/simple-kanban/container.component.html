<div class="text">
  <app-example-link path="sortable/simple-kanban" />
  <p>
    This example uses <code>&#64;ng-dnd/sortable</code>.
    It's similar to the other one, but doesn't use <code>ngrx</code>, just <code>Immer</code>.
    There are two kinds of sortable in play here:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>One
      <span class="span span--darkblue">horizontal</span> one, whose 'cards' are the vertical lists.
      Try grabbing a whole list by its header, and reordering.
    </li>
    <li>Many
      <span class="span span--light">vertical</span> ones, which contain the kanban cards. Try
      moving the cards between lists.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="relative">
  <kanban-board />
</div>
