<div class="text">
  <app-example-link path="calendar" />
  <ul>
    <li>Drag over the calendar to create a multi-day event.</li>
    <li>Double-click (or Force Touch) to create a normal event.</li>
    <li>Grab an event and move it around</li>
    <li>Resize a multi-day event with the handles on the end.</li>
  </ul>

    Note that this uses a full-on
    <code>&#64;ngrx/store</code> setup, and almost 1:1 actions to dnd-core events. This reflects the
    need to broadcast the state changes and computed
    values to every subscriber, not just the components where drags and drops begin or end.

    The design was mostly borrowed from the macOS calendar, and the CSS pattern is from
