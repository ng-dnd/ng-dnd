@ng-dnd/core\n@ng-dnd/multi-beckend\n\n\n\nThis package does two things.\nFirst, it re-exports dnd-multi-backend, react-dnd-touch-backend and react-dnd-html5-backend.\nSecond, it gives you a convenient and easy way to render previews when the touch backend is in use.\nInstallation\nyarn add @ng-dnd/multi-backendThen import the module and change your DndModule backend to a backendFactory like so:\nimport { DndMultiBackendModule, createDefaultMultiBackend } from '@ng-dnd/multi-backend';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    // ...,\n    DndMultiBackendModule,\n    DndModule.forRoot({ backendFactory: createDefaultMultiBackend }),\n  ],\n})\nexport class AppModule {}Normal usage\nYou will want to render previews. The  component is very helpful.\n\nCreate a \nAdd an  inside, pulling in the item's type as let-type, and the item as let-item=\"item\".\nRender whatever you want based on that information.\n\nA suggested arrangement is using an [ngSwitch] directive on the type, with one *ngSwitchCase per type.\n\n  \n    \n      {{ item | json }}\n\n      {{ item | json }}\n\n       ... \n    \n  \nIf you don't like putting reusable strings directly in templates, then try this:\n// item-types.ts\nexport const ItemTypes = {\n  TYPE: 'TYPE',\n  OTHER_TYPE: 'OTHER_TYPE',\n  THIRD_TYPE: 'THIRD_TYPE',\n};// your-component.ts\nimport { ItemTypes } from './item-types';\n@Component({\n  template: `\n    ...\n    ...\n  `,\n})\nexport class YourComponent {\n  // make ItemTypes a property on the class\n  ItemTypes = ItemTypes;\n}Using the preview component even in HTML5 mode\nSometimes, it is desirable to render a totally custom drag preview even in\ndesktop browsers. This might be because some browsers only show a small\nfeathered section of a larged dragged element, or just because you want to show\nsomething different while an item is in flight. You will need two things:\n1. An empty HTML5 drag preview\nYou can attach an empty image as your drag preview. Simply:\nOr:\nimport { getEmptyImage } from 'react-dnd-html5-backend';\n// ...\n\nngOnInit() {\n  source.connectDragPreview(getEmptyImage());\n}2. Disable the touch-backend-only check in the preview component\nSimply pass allBackends as true to the preview.\n ... Custom backends and transitions\nYou can also import anything from dnd-multi-backend and create your own\ntransitions. Refer to the original documentation, or simply to the autocomplete\nthrough the re-exported types in this package.\nRemember that you will need to create an exported function and pass it as a\nbackendFactory if you want to continue using Angular AOT compilation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -
